concept-graph-web is a web app intended to provide a way to easily and conveniently write down concepts and their prerequisites. I made it because I wanted a better way to make sure I have a solid understanding of things that I learn and can easily explain said things.

The server that this web app relies on can be found at [concept-graph](https://github.com/jm289765/concept-graph).

This project will not be further developed. It focuses too much on organizing knowledge and too little on creating it. Since the way knowledge is organized is often very complicated, this can get pretty tedious. And there are diminishing returns in the value of understanding how abstract knowledge is structured, which turns concept-graph into too much of a time sink to be worth using.

I do still think that writing out a concept's prerequisites is often useful. If I'm having trouble with a math idea, it's helpful to think about what prerequisite concepts it requires. But I don't need specialized software to do this; a simple text file is more than enough.

I am now using [incremental learning](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning). It gets rid of most of the tedious parts of organizing knowledge by letting the user's subconscious handle organization, and then keeps that knowledge in memory via [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/General_principles_of_spaced_repetition). It also has many other advantages over concept-graph.
