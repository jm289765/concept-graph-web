concept-graph-web is a web app intended to provide a way to easily and conveniently write down concepts and their prerequisites. I made it because I wanted a better way to make sure I have a solid understanding of my own ideas and can easily explain them.

The server that this web app relies on can be found at [concept-graph](https://github.com/jm289765/concept-graph).

Note that this isn't designed for, and doesn't work well on, small screens.
