concept-graph-web is a web app for editing the data structure implemented by [concept-graph](https://github.com/jm289765/concept-graph). It is a work in progress.

This project is intended to provide a way to easily and conveniently write down concepts and their prerequisites. I made it because I wanted a better way to make sure I have a solid understanding of my own ideas and can easily explain why I think they're true.
